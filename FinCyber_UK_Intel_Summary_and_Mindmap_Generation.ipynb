Recently, the revealed an exploitation of the ManageEngine ServiceDesk vulnerability (CVE-2022-47966) in another campaign. This exposure led to deploying multiple threats, with a new one identified as CollectionRAT, alongside an already used threat named QuiteRAT. \\n\\nThe advanced malware CollectionRAT has standard remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities, being able to run arbitrary commands on an infected system. Our intense analysis linked CollectionRAT to Jupiter/EarlyRAT, a malware family somewhat known to be associated with Andariel, a subgroup under the Lazarus Group umbrella. Interestingly, the group is gradually increasing its reliance on open-source tools and frameworks in the initial access phase of its attacks, as shown by Lazarus' use of the DeimosC2 framework. \\n\\nThe Lazarus Group's unchanging use of certain infrastructures, despite them being well-documented by security researchers, is another noteworthy observation. Their modus operandi, captured in the repeated use of the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), shows audacious assurance in their operations. But this approach also offers intelligence opportunities for security analysts on tracking these reusable infrastructure components. \\n \\nDespite their blatant actions, the Lazarus Group's dynamism is evident by their increasingly heavy reliance on using dual-use utilities for activities like reverse tunneling. Some of the reused infrastructure components hosted the new CollectionRAT malware, and an altered copy of PuTTY's Plink utility was downloaded onto compromised endpoints, further demonstrating Lazarus Group's rapid evolution. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the Lazarus Group continues to reuse and recycle its well-worn tactics while pushing ahead with new threats and evolving TTPs. This information highlights why there's a need for organized cooperation among threat researchers and the critical importance of staying up-to-date with the latest threat intelligence.\",\n",

            "Versa Networks has issued an advisory for a critical vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-39717 within Versa Director, a pivotal tool used for managing SD-WAN networks, commonly deployed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Managed Service Providers (MSPs). This vulnerability, characterized as a dangerous file type upload flaw, can be exploited by cyber threat actors to gain control over the affected systems. The urgency of this situation has prompted the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, confirming active exploitation in the wild.\n",
            "\n",
            "Organizations utilizing Versa Director are strongly advised to implement the necessary updates immediately. Detection opportunities include monitoring for signs of unauthorized file uploads and increased privileged operations on affected systems. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) may involve anomalous traffic patterns or unexpected login attempts. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) exploited in this context likely entail T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) and T1078 (Valid Accounts). For further details on mitigation and detection, professionals should refer to the official Versa Security Bulletin and the advisory report from Lumen, which delves into the zero-day exploitation of this vulnerability. It is imperative to actively hunt for and report any instances of malicious activity associated with CVE-2024-39717 to CISA to facilitate collective defense and remediation efforts.\n"
